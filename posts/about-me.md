My name is **Mats**, as you can see, and I've been a developer for more than 20 years. I started of as a simple developer working with **PHP** and **HTML**, because that was what we did back then. I later moved on to **CSS** and **JavaScript**, when browsers became standardised, and for the last 15 years I've been mostly focused on that. I am still, to some level, proficient with PHP and C# but I prefer **frontend**.

- The latest contract was **Kindred** where I spent 8 months working with React.
- in 2021 I worked for **JS Security**, a project run by **Helsingborg Design Lab**, and we created an encrypted online storage platform using **Laravel** for user management, **React** for the frontend and **Electron** for the storage management/client side.
